!Series_summary	"To investigate the metabolism by edodine treatment in Erwinia amylovora, E. amylovora grown with edodine. Total RNA from the cell pellets of E. amylovora TS3128 that cultured in MGY at 28 ºC with the control group and edodine treated group (IC50) was extracted. Our data provide differentially expression genes, including flagella biosynthesis, nutrient metabolisms, and protein folding, and RNA degradation, in presence of edodine."
!Series_overall_design	"RNA-seq profiling of edodine treatment and non-treatment in E. amylovora at 0.6 of optical density."
!Series_overall_design	"Edodine is a novel compound derived from microbe strain 761."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
